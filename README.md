This is an email web service with CORS enabled.
It's setup with env vars for the nodemailer config.

The purpose of this is to create an e-mail service for common things like form posts from my portfolio, emails for the band page services (password reset etc), and allow error handling emails to be passed from browsers (hopefully).

TODO: Integrate the whitelist code
